# Simple Math Interpreter in Python

A simple arithmetic and bitwise math interpreter writter in Python.


## What will you need?z
You will need to install `rply` package inorder for this program to work.
```
pip3 install rply
```

To use the `rply` package it's recommened to use python2.7 or python3.4+ as mentioned [here](https://github.com/alex/rply#python-compatibility).


## How to test this?
Super simple.

1. Run `python3 interpreter.py` on your terminal.
2. Enter math expressions.
3. The result is printed.

  #### Example Math Expressions
 - 2 + 3
 - 2 - 3 * (2^2)
 - 2.2^2 - (.3 - 2)


## TODO
- Support for more Arithmetic ops (%, post/pre increment, post/pre decrement)
- Support for Bitwise ops
